Welcome to "**Time Series Analysis in Remote Sensing for Understanding Human-Environment Interactions**".

The **main objective** is to learn new tools and methods for time series analysis of remote sensing data and to understand their fit-for-purpose application in Geography and environmental sciences. The focus on this year’s course will be on “3D/4D Geographic Point Cloud Time Series Analysis”.

The course consists of **two selected modules of a larger e-learning course** called [E-TRAINEE](\[https://web.natur.cuni.cz/gis/etrainee/]\(https://web.natur.cuni.cz/gis/etrainee/\)) that is jointly developed by the Universities of Prague, Warsaw, Innsbruck and Heidelberg in the framework of Erasmus+ and 4EU+ (see <https://web.natur.cuni.cz/gis/etrainee/>):

* **Module 1:​** This basic module will provide a background on principles of remote sensing time series, time series analysis, time series-based classification, trajectory-based analysis and spatio-temporal data fusion. Furthermore, validation and accuracy assessment principles will be explained.

* **Module 3:​** This core module will deal with 3D/4D geographic point cloud time series analysis. Surface dynamics within a local landscape occur on a large range of spatiotemporal scales. The analysis of surface activities and structural dynamics in 4D point cloud data has therefore become an integral part of Earth observation. These data contain detailed 3D information of the topography with time as additional dimension. This module will also feature Heidelberg’s open source Python library py4dgeo for point cloud change analysis (<https://github.com/3dgeo-heidelberg/py4dgeo>).

## How To Use the Course

* The course contents are provided via a [website](https://3dgeo-heidelberg.github.io/etrainee_heidelberg_2025/index.html) (which you are probably on right now).

* This website is automatically generated from the corresponding **Github repository**: [https://github.com/3dgeo-heidelberg/etrainee\_heidelberg\_2025](https://github.com/3dgeo-heidelberg/etrainee\_heidelberg\_2025). The repository is linked at the top right of the website on all pages.

* Some parts of the course are conducted in **Jupyter Notebooks**. These are static pages on the website, but it is recommended that you follow them interactively. Use the **download button** at the top of the respective pages (e.g., [here](https://3dgeo-heidelberg.github.io/etrainee_heidelberg_2025/module3/02_pointcloud_programming_python/exercise/m3_theme2_exercise1.html)). This will open the raw file in your browser, just right click and use "Save page as / Seite speichern unter..." to store the ipynb file.

* All **data** required for the course is contained in the [central data repository](#data-repository). Each theme contains information which of the data (directories) is relevant for the current task.

  * You can **report issues** via the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/3dgeo-heidelberg/etrainee_heidelberg_2025/issues) on the Github repository. Depending on the type of issue, they will be solved throughout the course or considered in future development.
